Current Scenario
User’s will get a login page with a link to do free sign up, in free sign up page user can enter his/her mobile number and should create password. An SMS will be send to his/her mobile number containing an access code. Upon receiving the access code users will be able to login, using their mobile number as username and user will be placed inside a pre-set plan (mobile users). Forget password option is also present which will generate new access code so that user’s can reset the password. 

After modification
Upon user registration, user will be able to select a plan of his/her choice from the enlisted plans and will be able to do payment through payment gateway.  For registered users once the initial plan gets expired he/she will be directed to a page where he/she can select a plan from enlisted one and can make payment for it through payment gateway.  Free signup link will be provided to the clients who will be providing free usage time to the end-customers (e.g.:- half hour free internet usage daily) on which users will be redirected to default plan upon registration.

GroupName - free_usage_plan {must be given by the user (plan/profile name)}
Attribute -  Max-Daily-Session
Op - :=      value must be statically inserted via sql query

id- autofill

Download Speed/Upload Speed    required drop-down kbps/Mbps  default_value = kbps 
so if administrator select kbps no conversion required.
But if he select Mbps then a conversion must be done ie final_value_to_database = input_value x 1000 [1 Mbps = 1000 kbps]



Max data Usage : required drop-down MB/GB    default_value - Bytes 
so if administrator select MB then

final_value_to_database = input_value x 1000000 [1 MB = 1000000 Bytes]

if administrator select GB then

final_value_to_database = input_value x 1000000000 [1 GB = 1000000000 Bytes]

max-all-session / max-daily-session minutes/hours/day(s)/week(s)/month(s) default_value = seconds

if administrator select minutes then final_value_to_database = input_value x 60 [ 1 minute = 60 seconds ]

if administrator select hours then final_value_to_database = input_value x 3600 [ 1 hour = 3600 seconds ]

if administrator select days then final_value_to_database = input_value x 86400 [ 1 day = 86400 seconds ]

if administrator select weeks then final_value_to_database = input_value x 604800 [ 1 week = 604800 seconds ]

if administrator select months then final_value_to_database = input_value x 2628000 [ 1 month = 2628000 seconds ]
